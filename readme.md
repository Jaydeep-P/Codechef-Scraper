Introduction:-

This script gets the number of submissions and accuracies of all problems in a contest and stores them in CSV files. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:-

Run the main.py script and give it the link to a codechef contest.

The script will run indefinitely, it will log the values in it's CSV every 300 seconds or 5 minutes. To exit, close the window.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:-

This script was made to log the number of submissions and accuracies, I wanted to plot them in a graph to show the spikes. 

My theory was that the spikes would coincide with a large influx of copied submissions. 

With some simple pattern recognition, we can identify the cheaters easily.
